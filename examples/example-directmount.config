-- Example configuration for direct mount mode
-- Use this when you have a large directory tree of projects
-- and want to mount the entire tree without syncing

    -- Enable direct mount mode (skips unison sync)
    directMount = true,

    -- Source directory to mount (default: "." if not specified in directMount mode)
    -- This will mount the entire directory tree
    source = ".",

    -- Mount configuration (optional)
    -- mountBase: Base directory under user home (default: "caged")
    --   Files will be at /home/claude/caged/public-projects/
    -- mountBase = "caged",

    -- mounted: Final directory name (default: project name)
    --   You can override to use a different name
    -- mounted = "public",

    -- User mode (recommended: "single" for shared authentication)
    -- userMode = "single",

    -- Network restrictions (optional)
